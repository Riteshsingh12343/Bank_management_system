The Bank Management System is a Python project designed to simulate basic banking operations using a MySQL database. It allows users to create accounts, sign in, deposit, withdraw, transfer funds, check account details, view transaction history, and sign out. The project uses the mysql.connector library to interact with the database, ensuring secure and efficient data management.

Key Features:
Account Management: Users can register new accounts with unique 12-digit account numbers, set passwords, and provide personal details.

Transactions: Supports deposit, withdrawal, and transfer operations, with each transaction logged in the database.

Security: Users must sign in with their account number and password to perform transactions.

Error Handling: Includes robust error handling for database operations and user inputs.

Database Schema: Two main tables (accounts and transactions) store account details and transaction records, respectively.

Usage:
The project is ideal for learning database management, SQL operations, and Python programming. It demonstrates how to create, update, and query a database while handling user interactions in a command-line interface.
